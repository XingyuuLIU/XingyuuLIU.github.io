<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Science at Yangtze University. I then earned my Master of Engineering in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing from Nanjing Normal University.

My research interests focus on human mobility and behavior, human-environment interaction and urban perception, especially on using digital traces of human activity to better understand social environment and how cities evolve. I have published three papers as the first author, including one in English and two in Chinese. In addition, I have co-authored three other papers.

[A Data-Synthesis-Driven Approach to Recognize Urban Functional Zones by Integrating Dynamic Semantic Features](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/3/489)

**Xingyu Liu**, Yehua Sheng, Lei Yu

- A new data-synthesis-driven approach is developed for comprehensive perception and understanding of the UFZs by integrating dynamic and static human activity data. 
- We build a weighted stacking ensemble classification model to obtain the final UFZ classification result, improving the accuracy of the recognition results.
- Our methods recognize the dominant functions and the proportion of urban functions within each analysis unit and analyze its spatial patterns and degree of mixing.
