<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Science at Yangtze University. I then earned my Master of Engineering in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing from Nanjing Normal University.

My research interests focus on human mobility and behavior, human-environment interaction and urban perception, especially on using digital traces of human activity to better understand social environment and how cities evolve. I have published three papers as the first author, including one in English and two in Chinese. In addition, I have co-authored three other papers.
